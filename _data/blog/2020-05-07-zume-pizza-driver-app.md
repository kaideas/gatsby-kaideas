Working closely with another product designer, I redesigned a delivery app for Zume Pizza's fleet of delivery drivers (called Pielots). The goal was to replace a legacy app designed for company issued iPads with native iOS and Android apps that Pielots could use on their own devices. The old solution had clunky UX (holding several pizzas and an iPad is not ideal), operations (Pielots had to pick up an iPad at base before they could start their shift in another trade area), and was expensive to scale. Our solution allowed Pielots to report directly to their mobile kitchen hub and use whatever device they were comfortable with. 

I developed Operational Mobile App guidelines to inform our decision making, prioritizing safety and extending our company values to the app experience. I did ridealongs with Pielots and delivery shifts using the legacy system to understand some of the usability pain points, and more with our new system to validate our solutions. While building out a design system to support both native platforms, I spearheaded our switch from Sketch + InVision to Figma, which not only saved the company $20,000, but more importantly improved our workflow and coordination with developers.
