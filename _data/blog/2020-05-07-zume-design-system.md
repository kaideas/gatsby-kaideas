I was the lead designer for Zume's first design system. As we were scaling from 100 employees in June 2018 to 600 by December 2019, we needed a way to design and develop products with a consistent user experience faster. By solving a lot of common problems up front—and with limited design resources—we helped our product teams focus more on higher level user problems.

I did extensive research on the foundations of successful design systems to establish our atomic type, color, and spacing systems, with help from another product designer. Working closely with a team of 8 engineers, I designed 20+ responsive and accessible web (Vue.js) components with documentation in Storybook, and corresponding shared components and styles in Figma. I collaborated with 6 other designers & engineering teams using our system to design products for the Zume Console, a suite of web tools to manage mobile kitchen operations.
