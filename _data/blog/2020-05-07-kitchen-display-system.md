KDS is a web app for restaurants to manage back of house food preparation on tablets. It ingests orders from multiple channels, and guides chefs on what items to cook when, which order they're a part of, and who to hand off to—delivery drivers or pickup customers. 

We first developed it for Zume Pizza with an algorithmically-sorted to-do queue and live statuses for 56(!) smart ovens on our delivery trucks. As Zume expanded as a B2B food operations platform, the product evolved as the key software offering for our mobile kitchen solution, supporting features like custom orders and multiple stations. We now sell it as a SaaS product for a variety of cuisines in mobile kitchens and brick & mortars.

Through various iterations over 3 years, I've collaborated with software & hardware engineers, 5 PMs, product & industrial designers, and stakeholders like Zume Pizza chefs, delivery drivers, and the operations team. I spent hours on our mobile kitchens talking to and observing chefs (even cooking pizzas myself), and testing software prototypes with cardboard ovens.
